# ValRank 1.0
 Automated Rank Verification for VS 1

This project was made in summer 2022 by Timothy Leung.
This program takes in an input csv which contains the player information including their IGN and tags 
and outputs a csv which contains their IGN, what tier they applied for, and whether they are verified or not.
